# Diabetes-Prediction-and-Analysis-Suite
This repository contains two main components: a Django-based "Diabetes Prediction App" that predicts diabetes using Machine Learning Algorithm(Logistic Regression), and a Jupyter Notebook that performs a detailed analysis and visualization of diabetes data.

1. Dataset Description ::::
Source: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases/
Patients: Females, at least 21 years old, of Pima Indian heritage/
Features: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age, Outcome.

2. Column description for DIABETES DATA  ::::
•	Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies.
•	Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration.
•	BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure.
•	SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness.
•	Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin.
•	BMI: Body Mass Index.
•	DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function.
•	Age: Age of the patient.
•	Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) where 1 indicates that the patient has diabetes and 0 indicates they do not.

From the data set in the (.csv) File We can find several variables, some of them are independent (several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome).

3. Project1:**Diabetes Prediction App** ::::
